**Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I am *Chaunnel Maeve Cruz.***

*This is my new personal GitHub Repo besides the one I mainly use for my other Cyber Identity.*


I am a cybersecurity enthusiast, CTF Player, and Programmer.

Programming since highschool using a normal notepad but already had experience with computers at the age of 5. Web Development, Penetration Testing (*HackTheBox*, *TryHackMe*, etc.), Programming, and Capture-The-Flag Challenge Solving are some of the activities I actually enjoy.
